# Stock Analysis
## Overview of Project
In this project I used VBA to create table showing total volume and return yields for a series of stocks depending on the year the user inputs. I then created a refactored version of the code in order to improve the execution speed

## Results
According to the data, the stock performance from 2017 was much better then 2018. Total volumes and return percentages were much higher across the board in 2017.\

2018:\

Below are the execution times of the original script:\

And here are the execution times of the refactored script:\

## Summary
The advantage of refactoring code is that it can improve the performance of the program, weather thatâ€™s the execution time or the accuracy of the results. It can also simplify the code or make it easier to read for someone else. There can be the disadvantage of making the code more complicated in order to improve performance thus making it harder to read or edit in the future, depending on the program.

In this case refactoring the code greatly improved execution time and allows to code to take on larger data sets such as 100 stocks instead of 12.
